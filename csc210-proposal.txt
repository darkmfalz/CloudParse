CloudParse

What is CloudParse?:
	Context-free grammars are at the heart of compiler design. As
	such, being able to prototype, share, and test such grammars
	quickly is an asset to any compiler designer. Currently,
	though, there is no integrated platform to do this.
	
	Enter CloudParse. CloudParse will be a parse-tree
	visualization tool, with social networking elements. Users can 
	create and save grammars by inputting the Extended Backus-Naur 
	representation of their grammar. Once a grammar has been 
	created, the user who created it can edit it at any time. 
	However, anyone can see the grammar, and create inputs it. 
	CloudParse then takes these inputs, sends them to the server 
	using AJAX, then parses them, generates a corresponding tree, 
	and sends the tree back to the client using JSON. On top of 
	this, users will be able to easily share their grammars with 
	other users and comment on the grammars of others, to provide 
	helpful feedback. 
	
	As such, CloudParse will be an integrated platform that allows 
	parse-tree visualization and the creation of a tighter 
	compiler design community.

Who is the target audience?:
	The target audience is, primarily, compiler designers -- 
	professional, amateur, hobbyist, and others.
	
	However, CloudParse can also function as an educational tool. 
	A secondary goal of CloudParse is to be accessible to students 
	unfamiliar with grammars and the nuances of parsing, with help 
	pages and question threads where experience users can respond 
	to any confusion.

How does it meet the minimum requirements?:
	Users can create accounts
	Users can add grammars to the database
	Users can make comments stored as persistent data
	Users can access grammars and other user accounts from the 
	database
	Users can update their grammars and account information
	Users can delete their own grammars and accounts
	All of the above is done using AJAX

How does CloudParse go beyond the requirements?:
	CloudParse's primary feature is its parse-tree visualization 
	and grammar sharing. As such, it will go beyond with quick 
	tree graphics generation and a robust commenting system.
	
	Furthermore, CloudParse provides a platform for compiler 
	design communities to connect, the likes of which doesn't 
	currently exist.
